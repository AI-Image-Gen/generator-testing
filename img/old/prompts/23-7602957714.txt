An ethereal underwater city, illuminated by the soft glow of bioluminescent corals, with towering crystal-like structures that reach towards the surface. Schools of iridescent fish swim past intricate structures, creating a vibrant and dynamic scene. The city is surrounded by a ring of floating islands, teeming with vibrant marine life and radiant flora, illuminated by the full moon's reflection. The entire scene is rendered in a hyperrealistic style, with the viewer drawn into the depths of the ocean, feeling a sense of tranquility and awe amidst the alien beauty.
