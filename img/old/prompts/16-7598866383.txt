A post-apocalyptic scene of a deserted city, where the only signs of life are the plants and animals that have reclaimed the urban landscape. The buildings are crumbling and overgrown with vines, moss, and flowers, creating a contrast between the natural and artificial elements. The streets are flooded with water, reflecting the sky and the ruins. The scene is set during a stormy night, with flashes of lightning and thunder adding to the dramatic atmosphere. The image should be rendered in a realistic style, with the details of the decay and the vegetation clearly visible. The scene should evoke a sense of melancholy and mystery, as well as a hint of hope and resilience.
