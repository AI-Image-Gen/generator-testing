An ethereal forest where the trees are delicate glass sculptures, each branch shimmering with multicolored lights. Fireflies with wings like stained glass flit among the trees, casting a kaleidoscope of colors on a winding cobblestone path. In the background, a gentle, glowing river flows, reflecting the magical light show above. The scene is set under a starry night sky, with a luminous full moon adding to the ethereal ambiance. This digital artwork should be rendered in a style that merges fantasy and hyperrealism, capturing the delicate interplay of light and shadow, and evoking a sense of wonder and serenity.
