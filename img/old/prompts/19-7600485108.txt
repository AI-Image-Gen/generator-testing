A serene underwater city bathed in the soft glow of bioluminescent corals, with giant, crystal-like buildings reaching towards the surface, and schools of iridescent fish swimming past intricate structures. The city is surrounded by a ring of floating islands, each teeming with vibrant marine life and radiant flora, illuminated by the full moon's reflection. The entire scene is rendered in a hyperrealistic style, with the viewer drawn into the depths of the ocean, feeling a sense of tranquility and awe amidst the alien beauty.
