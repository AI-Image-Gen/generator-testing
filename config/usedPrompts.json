  "A possible image description is: A capybara stands on a hill, holding a rocket launcher in one of its paws. The rocket launcher shoots sparks across the sky, as the capybara looks at the stars with curiosity. In the distance, a river flows peacefully, with fish jumping out of the water. The capybara is surrounded by other capybaras of various shapes and sizes, some wearing headphones, others playing instruments. The image looks like a scene from a sci-fi movie, with a touch of surrealism."
